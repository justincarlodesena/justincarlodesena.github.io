  <p> I went to the boba shop called "Siips Bubble" to order drinks, since it has been a while when I had one before the lockdown had been initiated.</p>

  <p> Around a week ago, I made friends named Yibin and Destin at a little park in front of a laundromat near where I lived. He gave me adivce about how to ollie while moving on a skateboard, which help me a bit since I started. A few days after we met we went to Kissena corridor park, which we stumble upon homeless people trying to survive the pandemic. Under the beautiful tree, there are a cart full of food, two outdoor chairs beside it, a man-made rack for drying clothes, a mini-grill and a tent. Apart from us staying at home to prevent the spread, there are people who doesn't have a home and are trying to adapt to survive during these tough times.</p>
