<h1>Bio, but not my bio-ish</h1>

<p>Hi! My name is Justin De Sena. And this is my first ever webpage. I didn't think I'll be able to create one, but here I am... Yeah. If you want to know a little bit about myself then here's a few... I guess... I like watching anime(mostly raeding manga), drawing and listening to Alternative rock or Lo-fi.Oh! I have a magikarp plushie. Dont ask me why I have it. I just have it; a friend got for me okay</p>
